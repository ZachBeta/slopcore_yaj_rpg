# Neon Dominance Web Version - Development Roadmap

## open world game

* dig up favicon - somewhere it got dropped
* typing and linting 
* colors are good, position and rotation are not, I think we tried to extract types to help that
* consistent map
* deno lint over eslint
* we need to keep our test timeouts short
* we avoid mocks, and use real objects as much as possible

* server diagnostics is getting noisy in dev logs
* tests are slow as hell

* convert js to ts
  * extract types out wherever possible

* multiplayer kind of works, players can join, colors still seem wrong
* connection limit is forcing dev code to contain a test check, bad design
* rules.md : prefer assertions over console.log in tests
* shorten timeout in integration test
* player colors are not consistent - red player should be red on both clients, blue player same
* maps are different - let's generate that on server start and find a way to relay that to the player
* generate a random username in the form "adjective noun"
* track player in the browser session

## soon
