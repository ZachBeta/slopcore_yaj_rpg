# Neon Dominance Web Version - Development Roadmap

## open world game

* connection limit is forcing dev code to contain a test check, bad design
* rules.md : prefer assertions over console.log in tests
* shorten timeout in integration test
* player colors are not consistent - red player should be red on both clients, blue player same
* maps are different - let's generate that on server start and find a way to relay that to the player
* generate a random username in the form "adjective noun"
* track player in the browser session

## soon
