# in flight
* [-] let's create a test suite to make sure the game logic is behaving as expected
  * [ ] handle deprecation warnings

# next 
* [x] dockerize the node app
* [ ] reroll the inline card ascii art into the card data
* [ ] reintroduce the threejs spinning cube on the main page, hide a teapot somewhere
* [ ] make the game screen more responsive - suggest the console run side-by-side on a computer, deal with mobile later


# soon
* rename across the board for "neon dominance"
* more iteration on demo mode
* set up a droplet to run this and share it
* add the mp3s and play them in the menu somehow
