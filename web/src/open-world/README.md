# Open World Game Module

This module implements a simple isomorphic open world multiplayer game using Three.js for rendering and a mock socket.io implementation for multiplayer functionality.

## Components

### OpenWorldGame (open-world.ts)
The main game controller that coordinates all other components. It sets up the Three.js scene, manages the game loop, and handles the integration of all the other components.

### Player (player.ts)
Handles player movement, rendering, and collision detection. It implements simple physics for jumping and gravity, and provides visual feedback for collisions.

### WorldManager (world-manager.ts)
Creates and manages the 3D environment including ground, obstacles, skybox, and lighting. It provides an immersive world for players to explore.

### NetworkManager (network-manager.ts)
Currently implements a mock multiplayer system where other players are simulated. In the future, this will be replaced with real Socket.io communication.

## How to Use

1. Import the OpenWorldGame class from './open-world/open-world'
2. Create a new instance of OpenWorldGame with the ID of a container element
3. Call the start() method to begin the game

```typescript
import { OpenWorldGame } from './open-world/open-world';

const game = new OpenWorldGame('container-id');
game.start();
```

## Controls

- W: Move forward
- A: Move left
- S: Move backward
- D: Move right
- I: Look up
- K: Look down
- J: Look left
- L: Look right
- Space: Jump

## Future Improvements

### Real Multiplayer
The current implementation uses a mock system for multiplayer. To implement real multiplayer:

1. Set up a Socket.io server using Express
2. Update the NetworkManager to use real Socket.io connections
3. Implement server-side logic for player synchronization

### Enhanced Environment
The current world is relatively simple. To enhance it:

1. Add terrain with hills and valleys
2. Add more variety to obstacles (trees, rocks, buildings)
3. Implement a day/night cycle
4. Add weather effects

### Improved Player Experience
To improve the player experience:

1. Add better player models with animations
2. Implement a more advanced physics system
3. Add more interaction possibilities
4. Implement a chat system

## Development Notes

- The code is structured to make it easy to replace the mock multiplayer with a real implementation
- The rendering system is separated from game logic for better maintainability
- All component interfaces are designed to be extensible for future features
