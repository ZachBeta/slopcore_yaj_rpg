# Isomorphic Open World Game Prototype

## Overview
A multiplayer web-based open world game where players can move around a shared environment and interact with each other (initially through collision).

## Core Features
- 3D environment rendered with Three.js
- Player movement controls
- Multiplayer capabilities
- Basic physics for player collisions
- Simple chat system (stretch goal)

## Technology Stack
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- Express for server-side
- Existing game structure integration

## Implementation Progress

### Completed âœ…
- Basic Three.js scene implementation
- Player movement with keyboard controls (WASD + Space)
- Player rotation with keyboard controls (IJKL)
- Simple physics (gravity, collisions with ground)
- Mock multiplayer with simulated players
- Player collision detection and bounce effect
- Visual feedback on collision
- World environment with ground, obstacles, and skybox
- Integration with existing game UI
- Camera follows player and rotates with player view

### In Progress ðŸš€
- Testing and debugging the implemented features
- Optimization for better performance

### Pending ðŸ”œ
- Real server-side implementation with Socket.io
- Enhanced environment with more interesting objects
- Improved player models and animations
- Chat system implementation

## Implementation Details

### Files Structure
```
web/src/open-world/
â”œâ”€â”€ open-world.ts       # Main game controller
â”œâ”€â”€ player.ts           # Player class for movement and rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ world-manager.ts    # World environment management
â””â”€â”€ network-manager.ts  # Multiplayer functionality
```

### Player Controls
- W: Move forward
- S: Move backward
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- I: Look up
- K: Look down
- J: Look left
- L: Look right
- Space: Jump

### Multiplayer Implementation
Currently using a mock implementation that simulates other players moving randomly. Future implementation will use Socket.io for real-time communication between players.

## Next Steps

### Real Multiplayer Implementation
1. Set up an Express server with Socket.io
2. Replace the mock network manager with real Socket.io implementation
3. Implement server-side player tracking and synchronization

### Environment Enhancements
1. Add more varied terrain with hills and valleys
2. Include natural elements like trees, water, and rocks
3. Add simple buildings or structures

### Player Enhancements
1. Improve player models with animations
2. Add customization options for players
3. Implement more interaction capabilities beyond collision

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Add in-game HUD showing player info
2. Implement a simple chat system for players to communicate
3. Add minimap for navigation

## Running the Prototype
The prototype can be accessed through the main menu by clicking the "Open World" button. To return to the main menu, use the "Back to Menu" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
