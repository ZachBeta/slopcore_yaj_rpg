# todo

* cards are not displaying or behaving in an understandable way yet, we need to iterate on that
* maybe establish the basic deck, and write some tests about how gameplay behaves

* game play loop walked thru
    * the display is stretching around quite a bit, we need to represent these as stackable/layerable cards - displaying a hand, and installed programs gets noisy and the display rolls off the top of the screen
    * once we can play a full game and exit to menu on win/lose, we can tag this 0.2.0


# whatever



* set up the cursor rules shim or windsurf, whatever
* get a crash course in godot (python flavor?)

# soon

* actually read the requirements xd
    * I think it's a deck building game like Dominion? I've never played netrunner, but I know it's a big deal
