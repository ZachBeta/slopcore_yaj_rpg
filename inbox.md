* move all pythonfiles into the python directory, root directory should have only shell scripts for easy onramp and a few top level docs

* render ascii versions of the game board and the cards, I should see my entire hand as a series of ascii cards
* write game state to a sqlite database, and have run_game and game_board_render both refer to the same game, so we can open a terminal to watch the game board, and a terminal to play the game
* containerize all python so it's easier to run on other userspace environments
