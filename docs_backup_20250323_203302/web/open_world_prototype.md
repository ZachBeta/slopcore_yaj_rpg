# Isomorphic Open World Game Prototype

## Overview
A multiplayer web-based open world game where players can move around a shared environment and interact with each other (initially through collision).

## Core Features
- 3D environment rendered with Three.js
- Player movement controls
- Multiplayer capabilities
- Basic physics for player collisions
- Simple chat system (stretch goal)

## Technology Stack
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- Express for server-side
- Existing game structure integration

## Implementation Progress

### Completed âœ…
- Basic Three.js scene implementation
- Player movement with keyboard controls (WASD + Space)
- Player rotation with keyboard controls (IJKL)
- Simple physics (gravity, collisions with ground)
- Real-time multiplayer with Socket.io
- Player collision detection and bounce effect
- Visual feedback on collision
- World environment with ground, obstacles, and skybox
- Integration with existing game UI
- Camera follows player and rotates with player view

### In Progress ðŸš€
- Testing and debugging the implemented features
- Optimization for better performance
- Chat system implementation

### Pending ðŸ”œ
- Enhanced environment with more interesting objects
- Improved player models and animations

## Implementation Details

### Files Structure
```
web/src/open-world/
â”œâ”€â”€ open-world.ts       # Main game controller
â”œâ”€â”€ player.ts          # Player class for movement and rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ world-manager.ts   # World environment management
â””â”€â”€ network-manager.ts # Socket.io multiplayer implementation
```

### Player Controls
- W: Move Up (Elevation)
- S: Move Down (Elevation)
- A: Rotate Left (Yaw)
- D: Rotate Right (Yaw)
- I: Look Up (Pitch)
- K: Look Down (Pitch)
- J: Roll Left
- L: Roll Right
- Space: Jump

### Multiplayer Implementation
Using Socket.io for real-time communication between players. Features include:
- Player join/leave notifications
- Real-time position and rotation updates
- Player collision detection
- Chat system (in progress)

## Next Steps

### Environment Enhancements
1. Add more varied terrain with hills and valleys
2. Include natural elements like trees, water, and rocks
3. Add simple buildings or structures

### Player Enhancements
1. Improve player models with animations
2. Add customization options for players
3. Implement more interaction capabilities beyond collision

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Add in-game HUD showing player info
2. Complete chat system implementation
3. Add minimap for navigation

## Running the Prototype
The prototype can be accessed through the main menu by clicking the "Open World" button. To return to the main menu, use the "Back to Menu" button in the top-left corner of the screen.

### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the `web/server` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start the server with `npm run dev` for development
4. The server will run on port 3000 by default
