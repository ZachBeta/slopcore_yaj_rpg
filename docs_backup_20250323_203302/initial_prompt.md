What would you like to research? I'd like to create a roguelike pvpve deckbuilder-rpg hybrid with multiplayer territory control elements based on the Netrunner LCG. I'll be using Blender and Godot to create the game. I'd like a research report for a comprehensive design document and implementation plan for the game, which should run in the browser and on mobile. It should have engaging, competitive gameplay with a tight core gameplay loop. The product and engineering teams should be able to start planning the project management and implementing the game based on the research report document. It should allow for integration with an Espresso-based EVM rollup that has interchain compatibility with Aptos and Redstone for web3 economic elements; these elements should not affect game balance (no pay-to-win, just cosmetic or side-grade options). Using blockchain for data storage properties is also a possibility via a framework like mud.dev rather than traditional databases.
