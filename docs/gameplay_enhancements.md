# Neon Dominance: Gameplay Enhancements

Key improvements for the Neon Dominance gameplay loop:

## Economic Rebalancing

- Start with 8 credits instead of 5
- Provide +1 credit per turn automatically
- Add 5 memory units total (1 extra)

## Enhanced Run Mechanics

- **Jack Out Command**
  - `jack_out`: Abort a run after encountering ICE
  - Success chance varies based on ICE type
  - Failed attempts may have consequences

- **Run Approaches**
  - `run <server> --stealth`: Fewer ICE encounters, costs more
  - `run <server> --aggressive`: Better rewards, higher damage risk
  - `run <server> --careful`: Easy to jack out, fewer rewards

## Visual Improvements

- Server structure ASCII visualization
- Distinct representations for different ICE types
- Step-by-step run progress display

## Implementation Priority

1. Economic rebalancing (immediate impact)
2. Jack out command (core gameplay enhancement)
3. Run approach options (strategic depth)
4. Visual improvements (enhanced experience)
