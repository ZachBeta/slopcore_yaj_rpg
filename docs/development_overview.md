# Neon Dominance: Development Overview

## Project Status

**Current Version: 0.2.1**

### Completed
- âœ… Terminal-based implementation (CLI mode)
- âœ… Full game loop with phases and win conditions
- âœ… Resource management systems (credits, memory units)
- âœ… Basic run mechanics with server interaction
- âœ… Testing framework with mock renderers
- âœ… Jack-out command implementation 

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Economic rebalancing (starting credits, memory units)
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced run mechanics with different approaches
- ðŸ”„ Improving card interactions and abilities

## Short-Term Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **Gameplay Enhancements**
   - Complete economic rebalancing (credits/memory adjustment)
   - Finish run approach options (stealth, aggressive, careful)
   - Add strategic decision points during runs

2. **Visual Improvements**
   - Integrate ASCII art for servers and ICE
   - Implement run progress visualization
   - Improve feedback for player actions

3. **Technical Refinements**
   - Expand test coverage for new mechanics
   - Optimize card data structures
   - Improve renderer abstraction

## Mid-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

1. **Corporation Gameplay**
   - Implement Corporation side mechanics
   - Add strategic ICE placement
   - Create Corporation economy system

2. **Card System Expansion**
   - Implement comprehensive Card resource class
   - Add advanced card abilities
   - Build card database with JSON definitions

3. **Enhanced Run Mechanics**
   - Develop server approach phases
   - Expand ICE encounter system
   - Implement advanced server content access

## Long-Term Vision

Following our project progression:

1. **Core Mechanics Completion** (Current Phase)
   - Finish all fundamental card game mechanics
   - Complete single-player experience

2. **Roguelike Elements** (Next Phase)
   - Procedural mission generation
   - Meta-progression between runs
   - Advanced card interactions

3. **Multiplayer Foundation** (Future Phase)
   - Networking infrastructure
   - PvP gameplay
   - Territory control basics
