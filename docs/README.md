## Guide to Project Documentation

This README provides an overview of the documentation structure for the Neon Dominance project.

### Core Documents

- **[development_overview.md](development_overview.md)** - Consolidated development plan with current status, goals, and priorities
- **[implementation_plan.md](implementation_plan.md)** - Detailed implementation steps for specific features
- **[ui_roadmap.md](ui_roadmap.md)** - Progressive UI development plan from terminal to full experience
- **[../todo.md](../todo.md)** - Actionable todo list for current development cycle

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Current Tasks**: Refer to `todo.md` in the project root for actionable items we're currently working on. This is the most frequently updated document.

2. **Understanding the Plan**: Start with `development_overview.md` for a high-level understanding of our current status and direction.

3. **Implementation Details**: When working on specific features, consult `implementation_plan.md` for detailed steps and technical guidelines.

4. **UI Development**: Reference `ui_roadmap.md` when working on interface components to ensure consistency with our staged approach.

## Documentation Maintenance

- The consolidated `development_overview.md` is the primary reference document that serves as the source of truth
- `todo.md` is updated at the start of each development cycle (typically 2-week periods)
- Supporting documents are reviewed and updated quarterly

Our simplified approach focuses on keeping documentation lean and actionable, avoiding duplication of information.
