## For Developers

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer

### Running Tests

The game includes a comprehensive test suite to verify game mechanics and functionality.

Run all tests with the test runner script:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

Additional options:
```bash
./run_tests.sh --verbose                  # Detailed test output
./run_tests.sh test_game_basics.py        # Run a specific test file
./run_tests.sh --help                     # Show all options
```

Alternative methods:
```bash
# Run using the Python unittest framework
python3 -m unittest discover -s cmd/terminal_game/tests

# Run a specific test file directly
python3 cmd/terminal_game/tests/test_game_basics.py
```

### Testing Best Practices

When writing tests for Neon Dominance, follow these guidelines:

1. Each test should be independent and not rely on state from other tests
2. Use descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Use deterministic random seeds for reproducible test results
5. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
6. Keep tests fast and focused on specific functionality
