- **Strategic AI Opponent**: Corporation AI with multiple strategic approaches
- **Complete Game Loop**: Card drawing, installation, runs, and win conditions
- **Resource Management**: Balance credits and memory units
- **Server Runs**: Make runs on different servers, handle ICE encounters
- **Jack Out Mechanics**: Strategic choices during runs
- **ASCII Art Interface**: Visual feedback with colored text
- **3D Web Version**: Three.js integration with interactive elements and easter eggs
- **Open World Prototype**: Multiplayer environment with 3D movement and physics

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Run the game directly from the root folder:

```bash
./run_game.sh
```

### Web Version

The web version of the game features a modern interface with Three.js integration:

```bash
# Navigate to the web directory
cd web

# Run the production version
docker-compose up app

# Or run the development version with hot-reloading
docker-compose up dev
```

Special features in the web version:
- Interactive spinning cube in the background
- Semi-transparent cyberpunk UI
- Hidden d20 easter egg (try to find the HACK button!)

For more details, see the [Web README](web/README.md).

### Command-Line Options

```bash
./run_game.sh --help        # Show help
./run_game.sh --seed 12345  # Set a random seed for reproducible gameplay
./run_game.sh --test        # Run in automated test mode
./run_game.sh --scenario full --delay 1  # Run a full test scenario with 1s delay
```

### Demo Mode

Run the demo with various options:

```bash
./demo.sh                # Run demo with 2s delay between actions
./demo.sh --ascii        # Run with ASCII game board visualization
./demo.sh --fast         # Run with no delay (for fast iteration)
./demo.sh --fast --ascii # Run with ASCII board and no delay
./demo.sh --help         # Show all demo options
```

### Alternative Launch Method

If you prefer to run the Python script directly:

```bash
python3 cmd/terminal_game/main.py
```

## For Developers

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer

### Running Tests

The game includes a comprehensive test suite to verify game mechanics and functionality.

Run all tests with the test runner script:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

Additional options:
```bash
./run_tests.sh --verbose                  # Detailed test output
./run_tests.sh test_game_basics.py        # Run a specific test file
./run_tests.sh --help                     # Show all options
```

Alternative methods:
```bash
# Run using the Python unittest framework
python3 -m unittest discover -s cmd/terminal_game/tests

# Run a specific test file directly
python3 cmd/terminal_game/tests/test_game_basics.py
```

### Testing Best Practices

When writing tests for Neon Dominance, follow these guidelines:

1. Each test should be independent and not rely on state from other tests
2. Use descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Use deterministic random seeds for reproducible test results
5. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
6. Keep tests fast and focused on specific functionality
